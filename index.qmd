title: "blog to follow my learnings"
---

I’m spinning up a Quarto‑powered blog—running it locally, publishing it online, and using it as a living notebook for everything I’m learning across machine learning, data science, AI, and agentic systems. Think of it as a public lab book: part documentation, part exploration, part “let’s see what happens when I push this button.” 

I’m stepping in with curiosity, a stack of experiments, and zero certainty about where this path leads. Which is exactly the point.
