    "text": "This blog is a living notebook. I’m building it with Quarto, running everything locally, publishing what works, and keeping the rest as a record of experiments. Expect a mix of notebooks, short writeups, reproducible code, and honest failure notes — part documentation, part exploration, part “let’s see what happens when I push this button.”\nI’m doing this out loud because the process matters as much as the result. Posts will range from quick riffs and reproducible demos to deeper walkthroughs of pipelines and models. The goal is practical clarity: show what I tried, what broke, and what I learned.\nWhat you’ll find here\n# Experiments and demos: runnable Quarto notebooks and small projects you can clone and try.\n# Notes and reflections: concise writeups that capture intuition, tradeoffs, and next steps.\n# How‑tos and patterns: practical recipes for data modelling, pipelines, migrations, and CI/CD.\n# Failures and fixes: debugging threads and postmortems so others don’t repeat the same mistakes.\nAbout me\nI build practical, data‑led solutions and enjoy getting stuck into messy problems until they make sense. I turn fragmented feeds and brittle rules into a single, reliable flow people can trust. I lead and coach teams, run reviews and roadmaps, and I’m happiest rolling up my sleeves to remove blockers and get things over the line.\nOn the technical side I work with data modelling, modern data pipelines and migration workflows, Python, SQL, version control, and CI/CD. I’m sharpening my analytics skills through a Data Science and AI course and I prototype quickly to test ideas in the real world. I’m a clear communicator, a self‑starter, and I like helping others learn so improvements stick.\nHow I work\nI favor small, testable experiments over long, speculative plans. Each post aims to be reproducible and actionable: code, notes, and the minimal context needed to run or adapt the work. When something is exploratory, I’ll label it as such; when it’s a pattern I trust, I’ll call that out too.\nJoin the experiment\nIf you’re curious about machine learning, data engineering, AI, or agentic systems, you’ll find something useful here — or at least a clear record of what didn’t work. Subscribe to the feed, fork the notebooks, or drop a comment on a post. I’m here with curiosity, a stack of experiments, and zero certainty about where this path leads. Which is exactly the point."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s the difference between looking things up and having things done. Search engines gives you information however Copilot gives you work already in motion. Instead of just fetching data, showing documents or answering questions, it interprets, drafts, prepares and prioritizes work and helps the relationship manager find time in their busy schedule. Below are some of the things that keeps them busy and we will provide a short guide to showcase what copilot can offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseCase\n\n\n\nactor1\n\nCredit RM\n\n\n\nuc1\n\nClient Preparation & Research\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc1\n\n\n\n\n\nuc2\n\nCredit Analysis & Underwriting Support\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc2\n\n\n\n\n\nuc3\n\nCredit Memo & Documentation\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc3\n\n\n\n\n\nuc4\n\nClient Communication & Follow‑ups\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc4\n\n\n\n\n\nuc5\n\nPortfolio Monitoring & Early Warning\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc5\n\n\n\n\n\nuc6\n\nInternal Collaboration & Workflow Efficiency\n\n\n\nactor1-&gt;uc6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few prompts that instantly make a relationship manager’s workflow lighter, faster, and sharper than working without Copilot. And this is just the beginning. Using Copilot is the first real step toward becoming an AI‑first organization by building everyday comfort with LLMs, strengthening intuition around model‑driven workflows, and setting the stage for deeper AI integration across credit, risk, and client engagement. Along with this initiative one can investigate agentic ai for the credit committee process which is repetitive and also involves may stakeholders.\n\nClient Preparation & Research - RMs spend a huge amount of time gathering context before meetings. Copilot can compress that into minutes. What Copilot can do:\n\nSummarize long financial statements into key trends, ratios, and red flags\nExtract borrower risk indicators from PDFs or emails\nGenerate concise borrower profiles from scattered documents\nCreate comparison tables across years, products, or subsidiaries\nDraft meeting briefs with “what to ask” and “what to watch for”\n\nExample prompt: Summarize this borrower’s last 3 years of financials and highlight liquidity, leverage, and cash flow concerns. Create a 5‑bullet brief for my meeting.\nCredit Analysis & Underwriting Support - Copilot won’t replace credit judgment, but it dramatically accelerates the analytical grunt work. What Copilot can do:\n\nCalculate ratios from raw financials\nGenerate sensitivity scenarios (e.g., revenue drop, interest rate increase)\nDraft the narrative sections of credit memos\nTranslate analyst‑speak into executive‑ready summaries\nIdentify missing data or inconsistencies\n\nExample prompt: “Calculate DSCR, FCCR, and leverage ratios from this data. Then write a credit narrative explaining the borrower’s risk profile in plain language.”\nCredit Memo & Documentation - This is where RMs lose the most time. Copilot can turn rough notes into polished documents. What Copilot can do:\n\nDraft full credit memos from bullet points\nRewrite sections for clarity, tone, or regulatory alignment\nGenerate executive summaries tailored to credit committees\nConvert messy emails into structured documentation\nCreate checklists for required documents\n\nExample prompt: “Turn these notes into a clean, structured credit memo with sections for business overview, financial analysis, risks, mitigants, and recommendation.”\nClient Communication & Follow‑ups - RMs spend hours writing emails. Copilot can handle 80% of that. What Copilot can do:\n\nDraft professional emails in seconds\nRewrite messages in different tones (formal, concise, empathetic)\nGenerate follow‑up reminders\nCreate client‑ready explanations of complex credit terms\nTranslate communications into multiple languages\n\nExample prompt: “Draft a concise email explaining why we need updated financials and how it affects their credit review timeline.”\nPortfolio Monitoring & Early Warning - Copilot can act like a lightweight monitoring engine. What Copilot can do:\n\nSummarize covenant breaches or near‑breaches\nFlag unusual trends in borrower performance\nGenerate monthly or quarterly portfolio summaries\nDraft early‑warning alerts for internal teams\nCreate dashboards or tables from raw data\n\nExample prompt: “Review these covenant calculations and highlight any breaches or trends that require escalation.”\nInternal Collaboration & Workflow Efficiency - RMs often coordinate across credit, legal, risk, and operations. Copilot reduces friction. What Copilot can do:\n\nTurn meeting notes into action items\nDraft internal memos or escalation summaries\nCreate structured handoffs for credit analysts\nRewrite technical content for non‑technical stakeholders\nGenerate templates for recurring workflows\n\nExample prompt: “Convert these meeting notes into a clear action plan with owners, deadlines, and risks.”"
